>>2. What does an IT Support specialist do ?
>>> Managing、installing、maintaining、troubleshooting、configuring

>**History of computing**
>>1. From abacus to analytical engine 
>>>1. computer(A device that stores and processes data by performing calculations)
2. Algorithm(A series of steps that solve specific problems)
3. Cryptography(The art of writing and solving codes)
4. Open source(Anyone could modify and share it) 
5. Binary system(The communication that a computer uses also know as a base-2 numeral system)

>**Digital Logic**
>>1. Character encoding
>>> defination:Assigns our binary values to characters,so that we as humans can read them. example: utf-8
>>Binary
>>> Logic gates (Allow our transistors to do more comples tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions)
>>2. How to Count in Binary
>>3. Abstraction
>>>defination: To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use 
>>4. Computer Architecture Overview
>>>Four main layers: 1. Hardware layer: made up of the physical components of a computer. 2. Operating system:allows hardware tho communicate with the system3. Software layer:hpw we as humans interact with our computer4. User: interacts with the computer

## Operating System

> **What's an operating system?**
>>1. Components of an Operating System
>>>explanation: The whole package that manages our computer's resources and let us interact with it,eg: Windows、Linus、Chrome.*I/O management*  means anyting that can gives input, or that we can use for output of data
>>2. File and File System
>>>*Block storage:* improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.*File extension:* The appended part of a filename that tels us what type of file it is in certain operating systems
>>3. Process Management
>>>*Process:* A program that's executing,like our internet browser or text editor.*Program:* An application that we can run,like Chrome.*Time slice:* A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.*Kernal:* Creates process,efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated.
>>4. Memory Management
>>>*Virtual memory:* The combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use.
>>5. I/O Management
>>>*I/O* Devices that perform input and output.When you are troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine,it's usually some sour og hardware resource deficiency
>>6. Interacting with the OS User Space
>>>*Shell:* Aprogram that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.
>>7. Logs
>>>*Logs:* Files that records system events on our computer, just like a system's diary
>>8. The Boot Process
>>>*BIOS/UEFL:* A low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to makesure everything is good to go.*Botloader:* A small program that loads the operating system.

>**Installing on Operating System**
>>1. Chosing an Operating System
>>>The Operating systems is used by an organization have a lot to do with the applicationgs and systems that they need to run.*Modern operating system* do a pretty good job ogf supporting commmon hardware.
>>2. Virtual Machines
